## Overview
This project demonstrates:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing individual feature distributions.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Visualizing relationships between features.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Training and evaluating a K-Means clustering model.
- **Model Saving**: Saving the trained model as a `.pkl` file.
- **Model Loading**: Loading the saved model and making predictions with new data.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `seaborn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pickle`

Install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kmeans-clustering-model.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd kmeans-clustering-model
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset with numerical features. Replace `'your_data.csv'` in the code with the path to your dataset file.

### Example dataset structure:
- Features: `feature1`, `feature2`, `feature3`, etc.

## Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
- **Univariate Analysis**: Histograms are plotted to understand the distribution of each feature.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Pair plots visualize the relationships between features.

## K-Means Clustering
- **Model Training**: Uses `KMeans` from `scikit-learn` to perform clustering.
- **Evaluation**: Clusters are assigned to each data point, and the results are saved.
- **Saving Model**: The trained K-Means model is saved as `kmeans_model.pkl`.

## Model Saving & Loading
- **Saving Models**: Models are saved using `pickle` as `.pkl` files.
- **Loading Models**: Saved models are loaded to predict clusters for new input data.

## Usage
1. Replace `'your_data.csv'` with your dataset file path in the script.
2. Run the Python script to perform analysis, train the K-Means model, and save it:
   ```bash
   python kmeans_model.py
   ```
3. To make predictions with new input data, use the provided code to load the model and pass new data.

## Results
- **Clustering**: The model assigns clusters to each data point.
- **Predictions**: Example predictions for new input data are shown.
